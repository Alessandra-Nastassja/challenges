## :pushpin: Motivation

In this challenge, I sought to improve my knowledge in React Native, joining my love for technology, finance and investments.

For that, I used this Dribbble design to get inspired by the layout development.

This was a challenge that required a lot of knowledge of CSS Flexbox, as I used it in the development of all screens, together with the help of styled-components.
